You should treat this like a job; if you were late or absent to work, you'd definitely want to be sure to let them know in advance or ASAP.  That's good. Though not showing up and not contacting anyone is very bad form. As I mentioned, you should treat this like a job, and if you don't show up or contact anyone until after lunch, things will not go well. Our job is to prepare to work successfully in the industry. You need to get in the habit of being reliably professional and diligent, even in the face of technical and life issues. Note: I am marking you tardy for today, since I didn't hear from you.  OK. I'm marking you tardy. As I've said twice before, you should treat this like a job. Graduating from NSS means that we believe you are ready to work as a professional in an entry-level position, on a professional team with schedules, deadlines and consequences. Moving forward, I hope to see you demonstrate your ability to do so, consistently and reliably.",

Roughly, I suggest starting with just signup/login, then create/read/update/delete budgets. That by itself is close to MVP. Then you can add expenses. Then payments to the budget. Then associate payments with expenses. Just an idea. Wireframes are very difficult to read. Please use consistently sized rectangles with solid background for pages, and use darker lines to make things more legible. The use of ovals for buttons is good, but then be consistent... don't use that for labels elsewhere. Labels probably shouldn't be in a box... it makes them look like an interactive element. ERD could use some consideration. What is the relationship between expenses and users? How about categories? Also, payments. We should discuss this.",

    "note": "Hi Yosief!  Great work getting this complex project up and running—kudos for all the effort you’ve put into writing this! I'm impressed by your consistency and perseverance. You're building great skills here, and I’m confident your hard work will lead to exciting job opportunities. Hang in there—you deserve all the success coming your way!  I noticed one thing: when a user clicks \"Purchase Combo\" without making any selections, they should receive an alert or notification about this. Right now, throwing a JavaScript error in the console doesn’t quite inform the user of their mistake. A clear update or prompt would be a better user experience.  Looking at the Sales function (linked here), it’s currently over 100 lines long and handles quite a lot:  Fetching Data: Retrieves collections like Vegetables, Entrees, and Sides. HTML Construction: Creates a salesHTML string, interpolating those collections. Event Setup: Uses setTimeout to add change listeners to radio buttons and a click event for the purchase button. While it works, this function is doing many different tasks, which can make it challenging to write unit tests for. Consider breaking it down into smaller, focused functions—this will improve readability, maintainability, and make testing much easier.  You're making awesome progress. 😊 Keep it up! ",

    "note": "Hey, all. I've included multiple instructors in this message, because I would like to privately address some concerns that I have had the past few weeks about Charlie and formally request that we no longer be paired in the same group projects. In this group, there were some moments where I wasn't listened to, or met with resistance when I suggested asking for help on things we didn’t know. And when I asked them for help on concepts I was struggling with, I was met with kind of vague oh I don’t know or just silence. Both times I have been in a group with Charlie, he gets frustrated and relies heavily on chat GPT and I don’t understand what's going on his code and when I ask about it, he also struggles to explain what is happening in his code. When I voice my concerns it seems to create conflict that no one really wants to deal with. And the solution becomes to just put my code into chat so it works. But I don't really gain any knowledge from that. Also Charlie has made inappropriate comments that makes me uncomfortable. This is ridiculous to type out, and yet here we are. On Friday, the boys were talking about how supposedly a lot of people are connected to Genghis Khan's DNA, and Charlie said \"Oh maybe that was his plan when he raped all of those people.\" And Yesterday they started talking \"about how aids started because supposedly some guy was hunting a monkey and his blood mixed with the monkey's blood. And one of the guys said \"dude he had sex with that monkey\" and Charlie made a comment about the guy \"raping the monkey\" and I said I should not have to be the adult to tell you this is not an appropriate topic for a professional setting. And they kind of mumbled oh yeah let's get back to work. Since no one seems to want to speak up, it becomes my responsibility, and spending my time teaching a grown adult man how to behave in a professional environment is not ideal. Overall I decided to bring it up here not because I feel like if it was brought up with the guys, it would just be dismissed or ignored. And truthfully I am concerned about being labeled as \"hard to work with\" or that I \"can't take a joke\" by people who might be my peers in future working environments, so I would appreciate your discretion when handing these concerns to prevent potential retaliation.",
