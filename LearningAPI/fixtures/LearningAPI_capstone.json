Managers are provided with proactive alerts when an employee or their declared family member(s) has a birthday, an anniversary, or a graduation ceremony. The alerts (triggered by dates provided by the employer) allow the managers the opportunity to formally offer use of an employee’s PTO balance for multi-day excused absences, offer a half-day in preparation for event planning, or perhaps an early release to provide the employee time to be both physically AND mentally present in their family’s important occasions. Sometimes, starting the conversation can remind an employee of important dates they may not have remembered! CMO assists employee managers with informing and conversing with an employee that they are due for a performance evaluation, constructive counseling, or they are in the window for an upcoming promotion. \n\nFor the employee, they log in to a dashboard that reflects their PTO remaining balance and the ability to request PTO, the ability to update declared family member’s information, and a display that reflects the last time they were evaluated and the last time they were promoted and discuss these topics via official conversation / message with their employer. It’s important to note, this application IS NOT a replacement for face-to-face appointments with an employer and should not be used exclusively as the discussion medium for such important topics.  \n"

Users will also have access to a basic turn or combat tracker that allows quick and easy inputs.

What does the stadium look like? Is it highly rated or potentially a waste of money?

This is where Crackerjacks comes into play.\n\nCrackerjacks is a React/Django application that gives baseball enthusiasts access to team information, park details and photos, average user ratings, and social interaction with other baseball fans/users.

This application, however, spices up the book club life. Rather than have the same cyclical conversations about the same characters with different names, this application allows users to engage with a specific novel, This Parallel Place, by introducing text-specific assignments which will take the Book Club Conversations to new and unexpected heights.

In short, tracking shared expenses is error-prone and tedious.\n\nMy project aims to solve these problems by integrating a standardized method for tracking shared expenses into a personal finance app by adding financial workflows for expense-sharing “teams” (friend groups, families, couples, etc.).

They're comfy and easy to wear!\" This line is amusing because it's such a bizarre thing to say as an introduction, but also feels exactly the type of thing a child who is super enthusiastic would say. This line is the premise of the forum, which is dedicated to the things that are great about shorts. I'm probably going to prompt ChatGPT to help make content for posts and everything great about shorts. Users would be able to make, edit, delete, and view posts and likes of specific users, with a built in path to their own likes and posts. \n\nReference : https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-like-shorts-theyre-comfy-and-easy-to-wear\n\n\nMy stretch goals are based on his other often quoted line is \"It's like my Rattata is in the top percentage of rattatas.\" This is amusing because Rattata are comically weak, so saying one is strong among Rattata is pointless outside of the context of battling other Rattatas. The stretch goal is to make a tiny \"pokemon simulator\" to show what it would be like to play as Youngster Joey. This would basically have a super short character setup, a repeated loop where the user/player can battle other normal/typical trainers with Rattatas, and finally a \"battle\" with the main character from the game franchise that instantly defeats the user/player.\n\nReference : https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/youngster-joey"
