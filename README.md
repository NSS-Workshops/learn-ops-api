# Learning Platform API

## About

This project is the API for the Learning Platform. It is a Django project using the Django REST Framework application. It integrates with the Github OAuth platform to create accounts and perform authorizations.

## Prerequisites

Your instructor needs to create a Github Organization and add you as an owner. You will then need the URL to that organization. If that hasn't been done yet, ask your instructor for the URL.

ðŸ§¨ You must accept the invitation to this organization before continuing.

## Getting Started

### Environment Variables Setup

1. Make sure you are in the `learningplatform` directory
2. Clone this repository
3. `cd learn-ops-api`
4. Copy the environment variable template: 
    ```shell
    cp .env.template .env
    ```
5. Open the project in VS Code and open the `.env` file
6. Set the values of the following environment variables. Do not change the values of the others.

| Key | Value |
